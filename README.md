# Venados Test
App for Dacodes testing

# Prerequisites
Have Android Studio installed (preferably the last stable version, 3.6)

# Running the project
First of all, you must clone the repository. This can be made by opening Android Studio and at the Quick Start Menu selecting "Check out project from Version Control" (or go to File -> New -> Project from Version Control), select Git option and then copy-paste the link from this Repository and select the destination folder for the project to download. After the project finish its building, you can run the app in emulator or physical device connected via USB by pressing the "run" button or the command "Shift + F10".

# Possible errors
One common error when cloning a repository project is the "Unsupported Modules Detected: Compilation is not supported for following modules: . Unfortunately you can't have non-Gradle Java modules and Android-Gradle modules in one project.", this can be fixed by going to File -> Invalidate Caches/Restart -> Invalidate Caches & Restart, then trying to build again.
